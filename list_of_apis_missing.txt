Missing APIs — generated 2025-12-01

Summary: This file lists API routes referenced by the frontend (or considered useful) that are not yet implemented or need follow-up, with a short description, auth requirements, work required, priority, and estimated effort.

1) /api/placeholder/[w]/[h]
- Method: GET
- Auth: none
- Purpose: Serve placeholder images used by demo pages (e.g., /api/placeholder/600/400).
- Work: Implement a route that returns an SVG or redirects to an external placeholder service; add Cache-Control headers.
- Priority: High (fixes visible missing images)
- Est. effort: 0.5–1h

2) /api/contact
- Method: POST
- Auth: none (public)
- Purpose: Accept QuickConnect / contact form submissions (name, email, message).
- Work: Add endpoint to validate input, store message (DB) or send email via provider (SendGrid/Mailgun/SES) and return success; add spam protection (rate-limit/honeypot/recaptcha).
- Priority: High (user-facing feature)
- Est. effort: 2–6h (depends on email provider & spam protection)

3) /api/markdown/[slug]
- Method: GET
- Auth: none (public) or admin for editing
- Purpose: Serve markdown content by slug (raw markdown + metadata or pre-rendered HTML). Useful for docs/blogs managed as markdown.
- Work: Implement route that reads from filesystem or DB (frontmatter parsing) and returns {slug,title,meta,markdown,html?}; optionally use remark/rehype for server-side rendering.
- Priority: High (you mentioned it explicitly)
- Est. effort: 2–5h (filesystem-backed fast version)

4) /api/index
- Method: GET
- Auth: none (public)
- Purpose: Return a lightweight site index for client-side search, sitemaps or quick listing (projects, blogs, pages).
- Work: Aggregate minimal fields from Projects and Blogs (id, slug, title, excerpt, tags); add optional type filters; cache results.
- Priority: Medium
- Est. effort: 1–3h

5) /api/upload/sign (optional)
- Method: POST
- Auth: admin required
- Purpose: Provide signed upload params for direct client-side uploads to Cloudinary (or other provider).
- Work: Create signing endpoint or server-side direct upload helper; ensure auth and permissions.
- Priority: Low/Medium
- Est. effort: 1–3h

6) /api/upload/:id (delete) (optional)
- Method: DELETE
- Auth: admin required
- Purpose: Delete Cloudinary assets from the server when removing images from projects/blogs.
- Work: Implement delete handler that calls Cloudinary admin API and removes DB references.
- Priority: Low/Medium
- Est. effort: 1–2h

7) /api/newsletter (optional)
- Method: POST
- Auth: none
- Purpose: Subscribe an email address to a mailing list (Mailchimp/SendGrid etc.)
- Work: Implement integration with chosen provider, validate email, store opt-ins.
- Priority: Low
- Est. effort: 1–3h

8) Admin helper endpoints (optional)
- Examples: /api/admin/stats, /api/projects/bulk, /api/projects/:id/feature
- Auth: admin required
- Purpose: Provide quick admin utilities (counts, toggles, bulk actions) used by the admin UI.
- Work: Add endpoints and admin UI wiring.
- Priority: Low
- Est. effort: 2–6h depending on features

9) Monitoring / error-reporting config (operational)
- Not an API but required: Sentry integration or similar for server-side error reporting.
- Work: Add Sentry init in backend, set DSN env var, wrap handlers optionally.
- Priority: Low
- Est. effort: 1–2h

10) Tests + docs
- Not an API but required for quality: add Jest + supertest unit/integration tests for auth, upload, projects, markdown/index endpoints.
- Work: Write tests, add CI job.
- Priority: Medium
- Est. effort: 4–8h

Deployment and verification tasks (related actions to make these APIs available)
- Commit & push branch (build) and ensure CI/Vercel deploy configured.
- Add required environment variables in Vercel: MONGODB_URI, CLOUDINARY_URL (or CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME / KEY / SECRET), JWT_SECRET, EMAIL_PROVIDER keys if used.
- Restart dev server to clear stale artifacts referencing removed routes (e.g., `/services`).

Notes & next steps
- I can implement any of the above. Recommended order: (1) placeholder, (2) contact, (3) markdown API, (4) index API, (5) optional upload helpers.
- If you want, tell me which endpoints to scaffold first and I will create route files + basic controllers and wire frontend where applicable.
